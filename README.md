# Hey there! 👋

   - Scrabble-solver in C++
   - Python and C++ utility scripts for performing server-side tasks
   - I am also working with microcontrollers to automate chores and to create alternative, safer IoT devices. More specifically, I am imporving a camera surveillance system I made previously. 
 
- 🌱 I’m currently learning advanced data structures and exploring sorting and searching algorithms
