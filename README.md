# Hey there! 👋

I'm Zeyad. I have a passion for learning and sharing my knowledge with others in order to develop cool things. 

- 🔭 I’m currently working on python and C++ utility scripts for performing some tasks. I am also working with microcontrollers to automate chores and to create alternative, safer IoT devices. More specifically, I am imporving a camera surveillance system I made previously. I'm also creating a few text-based games for fun. 
- 🌱 I’m currently learning advanced data structures and exploring sorting and searching algorithms 
- 🤔 I’m looking for help with developing applications for both Linux and Windows
- 📫 If you have any tips/suggestions, please let me know!
