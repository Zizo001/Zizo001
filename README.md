# Hey there! ðŸ‘‹

I'm Zeyad. I have a passion for learning and sharing my knowledge with others in order to develop cool things. 

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on python and C++ utility scripts for performing some tasks. I am also working with microcontrollers to automate chores and to create alternative, safer IoT devices. More specifically, I am imporving a camera surveillance system I made previously. I'm also creating a few text-based games for fun. 
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning advanced data structures and exploring sorting and searching algorithms 
- ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help with developing applications for both Linux and Windows
- ðŸ“« If you have any tips/suggestions, please let me know!
